# CI Pipeline - Build and Deploy to Code Engine
# ============================================================================
# This workflow automatically builds, tests, and deploys the application to
# IBM Cloud Code Engine when code is pushed to the main branch.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Dockerfile in repository root
# 2. GitHub Secrets configured: IBMCLOUD_API_KEY
# 3. GitHub Variables configured: IBMCLOUD_REGION, ICR_REGION, ICR_NAMESPACE,
#    RESOURCE_GROUP, PROJECT_NAME, APP_NAME, IMAGE_NAME
# 4. Code Engine project and ICR namespace created in IBM Cloud
# ============================================================================
